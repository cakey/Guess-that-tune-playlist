Song Inclusion by Year (24 Dec 2015)

A few notes here;
    - Years obtained by naively polling dbpedia with a text search. ~300 songs had no data, and an unknown number had incorrect years (maybe ~200?)
    - Generally an increase over time, with a dramatic increase in 1964.
    - Possibly songs to find in 1971-173
    - Another slowdown 88-91 - indicative of a poor period for music? my own taste bias? being born around that time?
    - Falls off again 2012+, likely for a number of reasons - songs havent had time to permeate culture, many recent songs sitting in the committee, the dbpedia resource does not have some of the most recent releases
